Fwoom
=====

A 2D space arcade game, similar to the classic Atari 'Asteroids', written
with WebGL and Three.js. I started this side project as a way to experiment
with in-browser graphics, GPU programming, and physics simulation.

[LIVE DEMO](http://davidmoench.com/fwoom/index.html).

This game is still very in-progress - only the bare bones functionality has been
implemented. 

Controls:
---------
* Arrow Keys: Accelerate the spaceship in the arrow's direction.
* Spacebar: Fire a forcefield blast to push away nearby objects.

Objective:
----------
You are a spaceship trying to break apart and destroy enemy blobs hurtling
through the void. However your spaceship has no lasers, all it can do is
fire a circular forcefield blast that pushes away enemy blobs. To break them
apart you must push them into space rocks.
